# MiniBar
**!!! WORK IN PROGRESS !!!**
```
This app is a basic launcher menu.
It is automatically positioned in the top center of the screen but it can be placed anywhere by simply dragging its top half.
If you wish to reset to its default position, simply click on the small circular button in the top right corner of the bar.
If you right click on the same button though, a context menu with additional options will appear. One of them is for exiting the app.
It can expand and retract by clicking the button with two arrows in the middle bottom part of the bar.
